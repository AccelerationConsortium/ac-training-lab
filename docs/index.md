The [Acceleration Consortium](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium) (AC)
Training Lab is a remotely accessible facility that houses a
diverse set of physical hardware for self-driving laboratories (SDLs) including
liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms,
and synthesis and characterization modules. Where possible, both educational and
research-grade hardware are included. The AC Training Lab is used to
develop and test SDLs and to provide a platform for training students and
researchers in the use of SDLs. The [AC Training Lab GitHub repository](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab) also acts as an example of
setting up an autonomous laboratory.

The equipment in the training lab can be broadly categorized in the following
categories: characterization, prototyping, synthesis, dispensing, environment,
and infrastructure. See the image below for an example of some of the equipment
intended for the AC Training Lab.

Here are some of the modules we have procured and are in the process of setting up (help wanted if you're in Toronto!):

## Workflows

The AC Training Lab is intended as a hands-on sandbox and prototyping environment for researchers. Each workflow will either be dedicated (permanent) or supported (non-permanent).

### Dedicated Workflows

While the equipment is not restricted to particular workflows, we are actively developing a subset of readily accessible workflows for the AC Training Lab. Note that single workflow could be carried out using different sets of equipment within the training lab. These workflows will use dedicated hardware in a permanent setup to allow for 24/7 access. The core workflows that are planned, in development, or available are listed below:
